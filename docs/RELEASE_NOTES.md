## üîß Technical Highlights

### Cache Management System
```typescript
// Multi-tier caching with vendor-neutral design
const cacheManager = new CacheManager({
  defaultTTL: 300,
  maxSize: 1000,
  storageBackend: 'redis',
  enableMetrics: true
});

const cache = new CacheClient(cacheManager, {
  namespace: 'mplp:context',
  enableSerialization: true
});
```

### Workflow Orchestration
```typescript
// Event-driven workflow coordination
const workflowManager = new WorkflowManager({
  maxConcurrentWorkflows: 10,
  enableRetry: true,
  maxRetries: 3
});

const { workflow_id } = await workflowManager.initializeWorkflow(context);
await workflowManager.startWorkflow(workflow_id);
```

### Enhanced Validation
```typescript
// Custom MPLP validation with caching
const validator = new SchemaValidator({
  mode: 'strict',
  enableCaching: true,
  customFormats: ['uuid', 'timestamp', 'version']
});
```

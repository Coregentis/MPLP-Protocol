# Architecture

Welcome to the MPLP Architecture documentation. This section covers the foundational design of the protocol.

## Scope

This index provides navigation to the **four-layer architecture** specifications that define MPLP's structural foundations.

## Non-Goals

This page does not contain normative requirements. All normative content is defined in the linked specification documents.

## Layer Specifications (Normative)

| Layer | Document | Responsibility |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **L1** | [L1 Core Protocol](./l1-core-protocol.md) | Data schemas, invariants, type system |
| **L2** | [L2 Coordination & Governance](./l2-coordination-governance.md) | Module lifecycles, execution profiles |
| **L3** | [L3 Execution & Orchestration](./l3-execution-orchestration.md) | Runtime execution, AEL/VSL/PSG |
| **L4** | [L4 Integration Infrastructure](./l4-integration-infra.md) | External integrations, drift detection |

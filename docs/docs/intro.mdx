# Documentation Overview

import PathCard from '@site/src/components/PathCard';

:::caution Authority Boundary (Read First)

**Authoritative protocol definitions for MPLP are fixed in the MPLP Protocol Repository**  
and rendered normatively on **docs.mplp.io**, including schemas, invariants, profiles, and lifecycle flows.

**mplp.io** serves as the public positioning and evaluation entry surface.  
It does **not** introduce, reinterpret, or override protocol definitions.

This documentation site **does not establish independent authority** and must remain fully aligned with the frozen protocol sources of truth.
:::

## Purpose of This Documentation

This documentation site serves as a **technical reference for implementers** of the MPLP (Multi-Agent Lifecycle Protocol).

It explains:

- how the protocol is structured,
- how protocol concepts map to implementation-oriented artifacts,
- how protocol behavior can be verified through **self-declared conformance and evidence**.

This documentation **does not prescribe implementation strategies** or operational architectures.

## Documentation Maturity and Consistency

This documentation set corresponds to **MPLP Protocol v1.0.0 (Frozen)** and has undergone a **full structural audit and protocol truth-alignment review**.

All normative statements in this documentation are traceable to the frozen protocol sources of truth  
(schemas, invariants, profiles, and lifecycle flows).

Any known ambiguities, clarifications, or interpretive notes are explicitly governed and recorded under documentation governance.

## Explicit Non-Goals and Limitations

This site is **not**:

- a product website,
- a marketing or promotional surface,
- a certification, endorsement, or compliance authority.

This documentation does **not** guarantee:

- feature completeness across all implementations,
- runtime behavior parity between SDKs, runtimes, or products,
- enterprise deployment outcomes or operational readiness.

MPLP specifies **lifecycle invariants and evidence structures**.  
Implementation choices, optimization strategies, and operational characteristics remain **explicitly out of scope**.

For protocol positioning, governance boundaries, and standards relationships, refer to the canonical MPLP website at  
**https://www.mplp.io**.

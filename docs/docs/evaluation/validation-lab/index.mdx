## What is the Validation Lab?

The **MPLP Validation Lab** is an evidence-based adjudication system for evaluating MPLP lifecycle guarantees. It provides:

- **Evidence-based verdicts** for Lifecycle Guarantees (LG-01~05)
- **Versioned rulesets** for deterministic, reproducible evaluation
- **Curated runs** with reviewable adjudication proofs

:::warning Four Boundaries (Non-Negotiable)
1. **Non-Certifying** — Verdicts are evidence-based outputs, not official marks or endorsements
2. **Non-Normative** — Lab does not define protocol semantics; see MPLP Docs for specifications
3. **No Execution Hosting** — Lab does not accept uploads or run your code; you generate evidence locally
4. **Deterministic Ruleset** — Same evidence + same ruleset version = same verdict hash
:::

## Terminology Partition

:::info Flow vs LG — Distinct Naming Spaces
- **Flow-01~05** = Protocol Test Scenarios (defined in main repository `tests/golden/flows/`)
- **LG-01~05** = Lifecycle Guarantees (Lab adjudication targets)

These are distinct and should not be conflated. Flows are test scenarios; LGs are what the Lab adjudicates.
:::

| Term | Definition | Role |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Lifecycle Guarantee (LG)** | Adjudication target (LG-01~05) | What the Lab evaluates |
| **Evidence Pack** | `manifest + artifacts + timeline + snapshots` | Input to adjudication |
| **Ruleset** | Versioned evaluation rules | Deterministic decision basis |
| **Verdict** | `PASS / FAIL / NOT_EVALUATED / NOT_ADMISSIBLE` | Output of adjudication |
| **Conformance** | Evidence meets versioned ruleset requirements | Evaluation conclusion (NOT certification) |

## Four Entry Points

MPLP uses a four-entry model. Each surface has a strict, non-overlapping role:

| Entry | Role | URL |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Website** | Discovery & Positioning | [mplp.io](https://www.mplp.io) |
| **Documentation** | Specification & Reference | [docs.mplp.io](https://docs.mplp.io) |
| **Repository** | Source of Truth | [GitHub](https://github.com/Coregentis/MPLP-Protocol) |
| **Validation Lab** | Evidence Adjudication | [lab.mplp.io](https://lab.mplp.io) |

## Version Taxonomy

The Lab uses four distinct version prefixes:

| Prefix | Name | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `site-v*` | Site Freeze | Website IA & public commitment |
| `pack-v*` | Evidence Pack Format | Pack structure version |
| `ruleset-*` | Ruleset Version | Adjudication rule version |
| `rel-lab-*` | Release Seal | Governance freeze tag |

:::tip
When you see `v0.x` in Lab context:
- In `/runs` page → refers to **pack format** (pack-v0.2~v0.4)
- In Footer/Home → refers to **site freeze** (site-v0.5)
- In `data/rulesets/` → refers to **ruleset version** (ruleset-1.0~1.2)

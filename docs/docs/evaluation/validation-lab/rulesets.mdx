## What is a Ruleset?

A **Ruleset** is a versioned set of evaluation rules that the Validation Lab uses to adjudicate evidence packs. Rulesets are:

- **Versioned** — Each ruleset has an independent version (e.g., `ruleset-1.0`)
- **Deterministic** — Same evidence + same ruleset = same verdict hash
- **Governed** — Changes follow Lab governance processes

:::tip Key Principle
**Same evidence + same ruleset version = same verdict hash.**

This determinism guarantee ensures reproducible adjudication that can be independently verified.
:::

## Ruleset Versioning

The Lab uses the `ruleset-*` prefix for ruleset versions. This is distinct from other version prefixes:

| Prefix | Type | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `ruleset-*` | Ruleset Version | `ruleset-1.0`, `ruleset-1.1` |
| `pack-v*` | Evidence Pack Format | `pack-v0.2`, `pack-v0.4` |
| `site-v*` | Site Freeze | `site-v0.5` |
| `rel-lab-*` | Release Seal | `rel-lab-0.5` |

## Current Rulesets

The Validation Lab currently defines the following rulesets:

| Ruleset | Status | LG Coverage | Strength |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `ruleset-1.0` | Active | LG-01~05 | Presence-level |

:::info Non-Normative Note
**Presence-level** means the ruleset checks for artifact existence, not semantic correctness. Future rulesets may introduce deeper validation (e.g., state transition correctness, schema compliance).
:::

## Ruleset Compatibility

Each ruleset defines compatibility ranges for evidence packs:

- **Min Pack Version**: Minimum evidence pack format version
- **Max Pack Version**: Maximum evidence pack format version

See the [SSOT manifest files](https://github.com/Coregentis/MPLP-Validation-Lab/tree/main/data/rulesets) for authoritative compatibility declarations.

## Ruleset Governance

Ruleset changes follow the Lab's governance process:

1. **Breaking Changes** — Require version bump and migration guidance
2. **Non-Breaking Changes** — May be added within minor versions
3. **Deprecation** — Old rulesets remain available for reproducibility

## What is an Evidence Pack?

An **Evidence Pack** is the input to the Validation Lab's adjudication engine. It contains all artifacts, timeline events, and metadata required for the Lab to evaluate your implementation against Lifecycle Guarantees.

:::warning No Execution Hosting
The Lab does not run your code or accept uploads for execution. You generate evidence packs **locally** in your own environment, then the Lab evaluates the pack against versioned rulesets.
:::

## Pack Structure

A valid evidence pack typically includes:

| Component | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| `manifest.json` | Pack metadata, version, and integrity checksums |
| `artifacts/` | Context, Plan, Trace, and other module outputs |
| `timeline/` | Event logs (e.g., `events.ndjson`) |
| `snapshots/` | State snapshots for diff-based evaluation |
| `integrity/` | Checksums and hash files |

:::info Non-Normative Note
The exact structure and required fields depend on the **pack format version** (e.g., `pack-v0.2`, `pack-v0.4`). See the [SSOT contract documents](https://github.com/Coregentis/MPLP-Validation-Lab/tree/main/governance/contracts) for authoritative field definitions.
:::

## Pack Versioning

Evidence packs use the `pack-v*` prefix for format versioning:

| Version | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `pack-v0.2~v0.4` | Current active formats |

Each ruleset declares which pack versions it is compatible with.

## Portability & Recheck

Evidence packs are designed to be:

- **Portable** — Can be exported and reviewed outside the Lab
- **Recheckable** — Same pack re-evaluated yields same verdict
- **Auditable** — All evidence pointers are resolvable

## Export Contract

The Lab provides an export contract for curated runs:

| Export | Format | Purpose |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `curated-runs.json` | JSON | Consumer export for downstream systems |

See [SSOT: `export/curated-runs.json`](https://github.com/Coregentis/MPLP-Validation-Lab/blob/main/export/curated-runs.json) for the authoritative schema.

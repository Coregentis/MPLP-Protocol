## What are Lifecycle Guarantees?

**Lifecycle Guarantees (LG-01~05)** are the adjudication targets in the Validation Lab. They define what the Lab evaluates when processing evidence packs under a versioned ruleset.

:::warning Terminology Partition
- **LG-01~05** = Lifecycle Guarantees (Lab adjudication targets) — defined in Validation Lab
- **Flow-01~05** = Protocol Test Scenarios — defined in main repository (`tests/golden/flows/`)

These are distinct naming spaces and should not be conflated.

## LG-01~05 Definitions

| ID | Internal ID | Name | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **LG-01** | `gf-01` | Single Agent Lifecycle | Evaluates presence of context, plan, and trace artifacts |
| **LG-02** | `gf-02` | Multi-Agent Collaboration | Evaluates presence of timeline events |
| **LG-03** | `gf-03` | Human-in-the-Loop Gating | Evaluates presence of confirm decision records |
| **LG-04** | `gf-04` | Drift Detection & Recovery | Evaluates presence of manifest file |
| **LG-05** | `gf-05` | External Tool Integration | Evaluates presence of integrity checksums |

:::info Non-Normative Note
Under **ruleset-1.0**, all Lifecycle Guarantees perform **presence-level adjudication only**. This means the Lab checks whether required artifacts exist, not whether they are semantically valid. Future ruleset versions may introduce deeper semantic validation.

## Evidence Hints

Each Lifecycle Guarantee has associated evidence hints — files the Lab expects to find in a valid evidence pack:

| LG | Evidence Hints |
|:---|:---|
| LG-01 | `artifacts/context.json`, `artifacts/plan.json`, `artifacts/trace.json` |
| LG-02 | `timeline/events.ndjson` |
| LG-03 | `artifacts/context.json` (confirm field) |
| LG-04 | `manifest.json` |
| LG-05 | `integrity/sha256sums.txt` |

## Ruleset Mapping

Lifecycle Guarantees are evaluated by versioned rulesets. The current mapping:

| Ruleset | LG Coverage | Strength |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `ruleset-1.0` | LG-01~05 | Presence-level |

See [Ruleset Reference](./rulesets.mdx) for ruleset versioning details.

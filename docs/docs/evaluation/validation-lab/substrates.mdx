## What is a Substrate?

A **Substrate** is an execution context or runtime environment against which the Lab has curated evidence. Substrates are categorized by evaluation tier:

| Tier | Meaning | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Tier-0** | Built-in / synthetic substrates | Lab-generated reference evidence |
| **Tier-1** | Curated with full LG coverage | Well-documented real-world implementations |
| **Tier-2** | Partial coverage / in-progress | Emerging substrates under evaluation |

:::warning Not a Ranking
Substrate tiers represent **evaluation coverage maturity**, not quality or endorsement. A Tier-0 substrate is not "better" than Tier-2; it simply has more complete evidence coverage.
:::

## Substrate Scope

The Lab's substrate index defines:

- **Substrate ID** — Unique identifier
- **Status** — Active, deprecated, or in-progress
- **LG Coverage** — Which Lifecycle Guarantees have been evaluated
- **Evidence Pack References** — Links to curated runs

:::info Non-Normative Note
The substrate list evolves as new evidence is curated. See the [SSOT index](https://github.com/Coregentis/MPLP-Validation-Lab/blob/main/data/curated-runs/substrate-index.yaml) for the authoritative, up-to-date list.

## How Substrates Are Used

1. **Evidence Pack Generation** — You run your implementation on a substrate to generate evidence
2. **Lab Adjudication** — The Lab evaluates your evidence pack against the substrate's expected behavior
3. **Coverage Reporting** — Results are aggregated by substrate in the Lab's coverage reports

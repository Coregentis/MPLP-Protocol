# Governance Constitution

:::info[Disambiguation]
**MPLP is not a software license** and does not define licensing terms.  
This document is authoritative for **governance process and policy**, but non-normative for protocol technical requirements. All normative technical specifications are defined in the [Specification documents](/docs/specification).
:::

## 1. The Supreme Authority

The **MPLP Protocol** is governed by the **MPLP Protocol Governance Committee (MPGC)**.
The MPGC ensures the protocol remains:
1.  **Vendor Neutral**: No single entity controls the standard.
2.  **Stable**: Changes require rigorous process (MIP).
3.  **Observable**: All decisions are public and traceable.

## 2. The 3-Layer Governance Model

To prevent scope creep and ensure clarity, governance is divided into three distinct layers.

### Layer 1: Protocol Governance
**"What MPLP IS"**
- **Scope**: L1-L4 Specifications, Schemas, Invariants.
- **Authority**: MPGC (Voting Required).
- **Process**: [MIP Process](/docs/evaluation/governance/protocol-governance).
- **Truth Sources**: [Protocol Truth Index](/docs/evaluation/governance/protocol-truth-index).

### Layer 2: Documentation Projection
**"How MPLP is EXPLAINED"**
- **Scope**: Documentation Content (`docs/`).
- **Authority**: Documentation Maintainers.
- **Process**: [Documentation Projection Governance](/docs/evaluation/governance/documentation-projection).
- **Constraint**: Aligns with Layer 1 Truth.

### Layer 3: Website Projection
**"How MPLP is DISCOVERED"**
- **Scope**: Discovery & Positioning (Protocol evaluation entry).
- **Authority**: Website Maintainers.
- **Process**: Website Truth Policy (See `governance/05-website-governance/` in repo).
- **Constraint**: Read-Only Projection of Layer 1 & 2.
- **Boundaries**: No certification, no endorsement, no product claims.

## 3. Relationship to Three-Entry Model

The **3-Layer Governance Model** (responsibility) maps to the **Three-Entry Model** (discovery):

| Three-Entry Model | 3-Layer Governance | Role |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Website** (mplp.io) | Layer 3: Website Projection | Discovery & Positioning |
| **Docs** (docs.mplp.io) | Layer 2: Docs Projection | Explanation & Reference |
| **Repo** (GitHub) | Layer 1: Protocol Governance | Truth Source & Specification |

## 4. Governance Documents

## 5. Release & Change History

All protocol releases, freeze declarations, and change logs are maintained in:

→ [Release History](/docs/meta/release/mplp-v1.0.0-release-notes)

## 6. External Trust

MPLP is designed for **Zero-Trust** environments.
See [External Trust Overview](/docs/evaluation/governance/EXTERNAL_TRUST_OVERVIEW) for the threat model and trust boundaries.

# Documentation Projection Governance

## 1. Authority & Scope

This document describes the **Documentation Projection Constraints** for the MPLP ecosystem.
It is **NOT** part of the Protocol Governance itself, but describes how documentation projects the protocol.

**Scope**: All content within `docs/` that is NOT part of the Protocol Specification (Layer 1).
**Authority**: Documentation Maintainers, subject to Protocol Truth.

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Derived Artifact Rule
Documentation is a **Derived Artifact**. It possesses no independent truth.
Every normative statement in documentation is traceable to the **Protocol Truth Source** (Schemas, Invariants).

### 2.2 Truth Precedence
If documentation conflicts with the Protocol Specification, the documentation is **WRONG**.
"Seeming reasonable" does NOT override Frozen truth.

## 3. The Truth Index

The **Truth Index** (`cca-truth-index.md`) is the canonical map of all protocol facts.
It serves as the data source for verifying documentation alignment.

> **Note**: Internal audit procedures (CCA, PDG) are defined in the **Engineering Governance Framework** (`project-governance/`).

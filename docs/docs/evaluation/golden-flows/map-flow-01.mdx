# MAP-FLOW-01: MAP Turn-Taking Session

## Scope

This evaluation scenario validates MAP round_robin mode with sequential turn execution:
- MAP session initialized with round_robin mode
- Roles assigned: Agent A (planner), Agent B (reviewer)
- Turn 1: Planner creates initial plan
- Turn 2: Reviewer evaluates plan
- Turn 3: Planner revises based on review

## Non-Goals

This scenario does NOT evaluate:
- Parallel execution (see MAP-FLOW-02)
- Single-agent execution (see SA-FLOW-01/02)
- HITL confirmation in MAP context

## Modules Involved

| Module | Role in Flow |
|:-------|:-------------|
| **Context** | Shared semantic scope for session |
| **Plan** | Steps respecting turn order |
| **Collab** | Session coordination with round_robin mode |
| **Role** | Participant role assignment and rotation |

---

## Collaboration Pattern: Turn-Taking

**Pattern Characteristics**:
- **Exclusive execution**: Only one agent active at a time
- **Token-based**: Execution token transferred sequentially
- **Ordered**: Turn sequence respects Plan.steps order_index + dependencies

---

## Evidence

| Type | Location | Status |
|:-----|:---------|:-------|
| **Golden Flow** | `tests/golden/flows/map-flow-01-turn-taking/` | Passed |
| **Input Fixtures** | `tests/golden/flows/map-flow-01-turn-taking/input/` | Available |
| **Collab Fixture** | `tests/golden/flows/map-flow-01-turn-taking/input/collab.json` | Available |

---

## Expected Behavior

- Turns execute sequentially (no concurrent execution)
- Roles rotate correctly between participants
- Collab mode is `round_robin`
- All participants have valid role_id

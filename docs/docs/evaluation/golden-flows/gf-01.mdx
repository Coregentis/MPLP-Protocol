# FLOW-01: Single Agent – Happy Path

**Source of Truth:** `tests/golden/flows/flow-01-single-agent-plan/`

## Purpose

This is the baseline single-agent workflow. The agent receives context, generates a minimal 2-step plan, executes, and produces a trace.

## Scope

This evaluation scenario validates:
- **Context** initialization from project configuration
- **Plan** creation with a minimal 2-step execution sequence
- **Confirm** single-pass approval (happy path)
- **Trace** recording for each execution step

## Non-Goals

This scenario does NOT evaluate:
- Multi-agent coordination (see MAP-FLOW-01, MAP-FLOW-02)
- Human-in-the-loop multi-round approval (see FLOW-05)
- Tool integration (see FLOW-03)
- LLM enrichment (see FLOW-04)
- Large plan volumetrics (see FLOW-02)

## L2 Modules Exercised

| Module | Role in Flow |
|:-------|:-------------|
| **Context** | Establishes problem domain and execution environment |
| **Plan** | Defines 2-step execution strategy |
| **Confirm** | Single-pass approval (approved immediately) |
| **Trace** | Records all runtime events |

---

## Key Protocol Fields

### Context
- `context_id`: UUID v4
- `root.domain`: "golden-test"
- `root.environment`: "simulation"
- `status`: "draft" → "active"
- `owner_role`: "agent"

### Plan
- `plan_id`: UUID v4
- `context_id`: Reference to parent context
- `steps[]`: 2 steps with `step_id`, `description`, `status`
- `meta.protocol_version`: "1.0.0"

### Confirm
- `confirm_id`: UUID v4
- `status`: "pending" → "approved"
- `approver_role`: "agent-self"

### Trace
- `trace_id`: UUID v4
- `events[]`: Chronological execution events
- `meta.total_duration_ms`: Total execution time

---

## Integration Dimensions (L3/L4)

**None.** FLOW-01 deliberately excludes all L3/L4 integration:
- No Tool Integration
- No LLM Backend
- No Storage Integration
- No Multi-Agent Coordination

This minimal footprint ensures validation failures are attributable to L2 protocol layer only.

## Evidence

| Type | Location | Status |
|:-----|:---------|:-------|
| **Golden Flow** | `tests/golden/flows/flow-01-single-agent-plan/` | ✅ Passed |
| **Input Fixtures** | `tests/golden/flows/flow-01-single-agent-plan/input/` | Available |
| **Expected Fixtures** | `tests/golden/flows/flow-01-single-agent-plan/expected/` | Available |

---

## Expected Behavior

- Context is created once and remains immutable
- Plan with 2 steps is generated and approved
- All trace entries are immutable and chronologically ordered
- Final state matches expected output fixtures

---

## Invariants Tested

- All `step_id` values must be unique UUID v4
- All `description` fields must be non-empty
- Timestamps must be ISO 8601 format
- Context immutability preserved throughout flow

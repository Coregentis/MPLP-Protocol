# SA-FLOW-02: SA Multi-Step Evaluation

## Scope

This evaluation scenario validates multi-step execution in SA profile:
- SA loads Context with multi-step Plan
- SA processes steps by order_index sequence
- Each step status updated correctly
- Context remains stable across execution

## Non-Goals

This scenario does NOT evaluate:
- Single-step execution (see SA-FLOW-01)
- Tool integration (see FLOW-03)
- LLM enrichment (see FLOW-04)

## Modules Involved

| Module | Role in Flow |
|:-------|:-------------|
| **Context** | Provides stable execution boundary |
| **Plan** | Defines multiple ordered steps |

---

## Evidence

| Type | Location | Status |
|:-----|:---------|:-------|
| **Golden Flow** | `tests/golden/flows/sa-flow-02-step-evaluation/` | Passed |
| **Input Fixtures** | `tests/golden/flows/sa-flow-02-step-evaluation/input/` | Available |
| **Expected Fixtures** | `tests/golden/flows/sa-flow-02-step-evaluation/expected/` | Available |

---

## Expected Behavior

- Steps execute in order_index sequence
- Step status transitions: pending → in_progress → completed
- Context immutability preserved
- All step_ids are valid UUID v4

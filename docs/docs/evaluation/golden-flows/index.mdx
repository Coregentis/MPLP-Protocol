# Golden Flows — Informative (Non-Normative)

Golden Flows are **evaluation scenarios** that describe expected behavior for MPLP implementations.

:::info Terminology Note — Flow vs LG
- **Flow-01~05** = Protocol Test Scenarios (defined in this repository at `tests/golden/flows/`)
- **LG-01~05** = Lifecycle Guarantees (Validation Lab adjudication targets)

These are **distinct naming spaces** and should not be conflated. Flows are test scenarios for protocol conformance; LGs are what the Validation Lab adjudicates against evidence packs.

→ See [Lifecycle Guarantees Reference](/docs/evaluation/validation-lab/lifecycle-guarantees) for Lab adjudication objects.

## How to Use This Section

| Your Goal | Start Here |
|:---|:---|
| **Verify single-agent implementation** | [FLOW-01: Single Agent – Happy Path](./gf-01.mdx) |
| **Test tool integration** | [FLOW-03: Single Agent – With Tools](./gf-03.mdx) |
| **Validate confirmation flows** | [FLOW-05: Single Agent with Confirm Required](./gf-05.mdx) |
| **Understand SA profile** | [SA-FLOW-01: SA Basic Execution](./sa-flow-01.mdx) |
| **Understand MAP coordination** | [MAP-FLOW-01: MAP Turn-Taking Session](./map-flow-01.mdx) |

## Core Flows (v1.0 Compliance Boundary)

| Flow | Name | Purpose | Modules Involved |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **FLOW-01** | [Single Agent – Happy Path](./gf-01.mdx) | Baseline 2-step plan execution | Context, Plan, Trace |
| **FLOW-02** | [Single Agent – Large Plan](./gf-02.mdx) | Volumetric 20+ step validation | Context, Plan, Trace |
| **FLOW-03** | [Single Agent – With Tools](./gf-03.mdx) | Tool integration via agent_role | Context, Plan, Trace |
| **FLOW-04** | [Single Agent with LLM Enrichment](./gf-04.mdx) | AEL reasoning integration | Context, Plan, Trace, Core |
| **FLOW-05** | [Single Agent with Confirm Required](./gf-05.mdx) | Multi-round approval | Context, Plan, Confirm, Trace |

## SA Profile Flows

| Flow | Name | Purpose | Modules Involved |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **SA-FLOW-01** | SA Basic Execution | Single-step SA lifecycle | Context, Plan |
| **SA-FLOW-02** | SA Multi-Step Evaluation | Multi-step SA validation | Context, Plan |

## MAP Profile Flows

| Flow | Name | Purpose | Modules Involved |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **MAP-FLOW-01** | MAP Turn-Taking Session | Sequential multi-agent coordination | Context, Plan, Collab, Role |
| **MAP-FLOW-02** | MAP Broadcast Fan-out | Parallel multi-agent dispatch | Context, Plan, Collab, Role |

## Traceability

All Golden Flows are mapped to:
- **Modules** they validate
- **Cross-Cutting Duties** they exercise
- **Test files** in `tests/golden/flows/`



## Change Policy

Golden Flows are **Normative**:
- Semantic changes require MPGC approval
- Test files in `tests/golden/flows/` are the source of truth
- All downstream content must align with source of truth

**Document Status**: Normative (Validation Scenarios)  
**Total Flows**: 9 (5 Core + 2 SA + 2 MAP)  
**Source of Truth**: `tests/golden/flows/`

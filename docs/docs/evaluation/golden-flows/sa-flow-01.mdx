# SA-FLOW-01: SA Basic Execution

## Scope

This evaluation scenario describes a minimal Single-Agent (SA) profile execution:
- SA initializes and loads Context
- SA evaluates a single-step Plan
- SA executes the step with valid agent_role
- SA completes the lifecycle cleanly

## Non-Goals

This scenario does NOT evaluate:
- Multi-step execution (see SA-FLOW-02)
- Multi-agent coordination (see MAP-FLOW-01/02)
- Tool integration (see FLOW-03)

## Modules Involved

| Module | Role in Flow |
|:-------|:-------------|
| **Context** | Provides initial constraints and objectives |
| **Plan** | Defines single execution step |

---

## Evidence

| Type | Location | Status |
|:-----|:---------|:-------|
| **Golden Flow** | `tests/golden/flows/sa-flow-01-basic/` | Passed |
| **Input Fixtures** | `tests/golden/flows/sa-flow-01-basic/input/` | Available |
| **Expected Fixtures** | `tests/golden/flows/sa-flow-01-basic/expected/` | Available |

---

## Expected Behavior

- SA lifecycle: `initialize → load_context → execute_step → complete`
- Context remains immutable
- Step status updated correctly
- agent_role field validated

# MAP-FLOW-02: MAP Broadcast Fan-out

## Scope

This evaluation scenario validates MAP broadcast mode with parallel agent execution:
- MAP session initialized with broadcast mode
- 3+ agents registered as participants
- Task broadcast to all participants simultaneously
- Responses collected from all agents
- Results aggregated into final output

## Non-Goals

This scenario does NOT evaluate:
- Sequential turn-taking (see MAP-FLOW-01)
- Single-agent execution (see SA-FLOW-01/02)
- Tool integration in MAP context

## Modules Involved

| Module | Role in Flow |
|:-------|:-------------|
| **Context** | Shared semantic scope for session |
| **Plan** | Task definition for broadcast |
| **Collab** | Session coordination with broadcast mode |
| **Role** | Participant registration |

---

## Collaboration Pattern: Broadcast Fan-out

**Pattern Characteristics**:
- **Parallel dispatch**: All participants receive simultaneously
- **Non-exclusive**: Multiple agents active concurrently
- **Aggregated**: Results merged from all responses

## Evidence

| Type | Location | Status |
|:-----|:---------|:-------|
| **Golden Flow** | `tests/golden/flows/map-flow-02-broadcast-fanout/` | Passed |
| **Input Fixtures** | `tests/golden/flows/map-flow-02-broadcast-fanout/input/` | Available |
| **Collab Fixture** | `tests/golden/flows/map-flow-02-broadcast-fanout/input/collab.json` | Available |

## Expected Behavior

- Broadcast reaches all registered participants
- Parallel execution succeeds
- All responses collected
- Result aggregation complete
- Collab mode is `broadcast`

> "Can I prove what the agents did, why they did it, and whether the system stayed within approved lifecycle guarantees?"

MPLP's answer is: **evidence-first lifecycle governance**, not "trust the prompt" or "trust best practices".

## 2. What This Section Is NOT

This section does **not** provide:

- **Certification**, endorsement, or compliance badges
- **Legal advice** or regulatory determinations
- A mandatory runtime, SDK, or framework adapter
- "One true" implementation pattern for agents

MPLP is **vendor-neutral** by design. Conformance is judged by **evidence**, not by brand names or frameworks.

## 3. How to Use This Section

| Your Goal | Start Here |
|:---|:---|
| Understand conformance model | [Conformance Model](./conformance-model.md) |
| Understand evidence structure | [Evidence Model](./evidence-model.md) |
| See evaluation axes | [Evaluation Dimensions](./evaluation-dimensions.md) |
| Understand result semantics | [Results & Status](./results-and-status.md) |
| See future plans | [Roadmap](./roadmap.mdx) |
| Practical evaluation steps | [Conformance Guide](/docs/guides/conformance-guide) |
| Validate with Golden Flows | [Golden Flows](/docs/evaluation/golden-flows) |

## 4. Core Principles

### 4.1 Evidence-First

Conformance is judged by **exported evidence**, not runtime inspection:

| Evidence Type | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| **Plan** | Intent declaration |
| **Confirm** | Governance gate record |
| **Trace** | Execution history |
| **Snapshot** | State checkpoint |
| **Manifest** | Configuration declaration |

### 4.2 Vendor Neutral

Evidence does not depend on proprietary runtime features to be interpretable. Any conformant runtime MUST produce evidence that:

- Uses MPLP JSON Schemas
- Is self-describing (contains protocol version)
- Is replayable (trace can reconstruct timeline)

### 4.3 Non-Certification

MPLP does **not** provide:
- Certification programs
- Compliance badges
- Runtime endorsements

Conformance is a **binary outcome** (conformant / non-conformant / incomplete-evidence), not a score or certification level.

## 5. Minimal Conformance Checklist

Use this as a quick sanity check before deeper evaluation:

| # | Check | Evidence Source |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | **Protocol version declared** | `meta.protocolVersion` in artifacts |
| 2 | **Plan → Confirm → Trace chain exists** | Linked IDs across objects |
| 3 | **High-risk actions gated** | `Confirm` objects for gated steps |
| 4 | **Replayability** | Trace segments with timestamps |
| 5 | **Bounded failure** | Recovery events or safe-stop records |

## 6. Conformance Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| [Conformance Model](./conformance-model.md) | Conformance classes (L1/L2/L3) and outcomes |
| [Evidence Model](./evidence-model.md) | What constitutes valid evidence |
| [Evaluation Dimensions](./evaluation-dimensions.md) | 6 axes for judging conformance |
| [Results & Status](./results-and-status.md) | Outcome semantics and reporting |
| [Roadmap](./roadmap.mdx) | Future plans and boundaries |
| [Conformance Guide](/docs/guides/conformance-guide) | Practical evaluation workflow |
| [Conformance Checklist](/docs/guides/conformance-checklist) | Vendor self-verification template |

## 8. Evidence Adjudication (Validation Lab)

For evidence-based verdict generation and adjudication, see the **Validation Lab**:

| Resource | Description | Link |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Lifecycle Guarantees** | LG-01~05 adjudication targets | [Docs Reference](/docs/evaluation/validation-lab/lifecycle-guarantees) / [Lab](https://lab.mplp.io/guarantees) |
| **Rulesets** | Versioned evaluation rules | [Docs Reference](/docs/evaluation/validation-lab/rulesets) / [Lab](https://lab.mplp.io/rulesets) |
| **Evidence Pack Contract** | Pack structure & format | [Docs Reference](/docs/evaluation/validation-lab/evidence-pack-contract) / [Lab Policy](https://lab.mplp.io/policies/contract) |
| **Terminology** | Flow vs LG naming conventions | [Docs Reference](/docs/evaluation/validation-lab/terminology) |

:::info Terminology Note
- **Flow-01~05** = Protocol Test Scenarios (this repository)
- **LG-01~05** = Lifecycle Guarantees (Lab adjudication targets)

These are distinct naming spaces. See [Terminology Reference](/docs/evaluation/validation-lab/terminology) for details.

:::warning Non-Certification Boundary
The Validation Lab provides **evidence-based verdicts**, not certification, badges, or endorsements. Verdicts are reproducible outputs: same evidence + same ruleset = same verdict hash.

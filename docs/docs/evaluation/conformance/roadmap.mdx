# Conformance Roadmap

> [!NOTE]
> This document describes **future plans**, not current capabilities.
> All features listed here are subject to change.

## 1. Purpose

This roadmap outlines planned enhancements to MPLP conformance evaluation. It clarifies:

- What is **not** in v1.0.0
- What may be added in future versions
- Governance constraints on extensions

## 2. Current State (v1.0.0)

### 2.1 What v1.0.0 Provides

| Capability | Status |
|:---|:---|
| Schema validation | ✅ Available |
| Evidence Pack structure | ✅ Defined |
| Conformance Model (L1/L2/L3) | ✅ Defined |
| Evaluation Dimensions (6 axes) | ✅ Defined |
| Outcome semantics | ✅ Defined |
| Golden Flow alignment | ✅ Defined |

### 2.2 What v1.0.0 Does NOT Provide

| Capability | Status | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Certification | ❌ Not planned | Outside scope |
| Compliance badges | ❌ Not planned | Outside scope |
| Runtime inspection | ❌ Not in v1.0 | Evidence-only evaluation |
| Multi-agent coordination checks | ⏳ Future | Planned for v1.1+ |
| Performance evaluation | ⏳ Future | Under consideration |
| Security boundary evaluation | ⏳ Future | Under consideration |

## 3. Planned Enhancements

### 3.1 v1.1 (Planned)

| Feature | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **MAP Conformance** | Evaluation dimensions for Multi-Agent Profile |
| **Collab State Validation** | Verify multi-agent coordination evidence |
| **Extended Events** | Evaluate runtime event sequences |

### 3.2 v1.2+ (Under Consideration)

| Feature | Description | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Streaming evaluation | Evaluate evidence as it's produced | Research |
| Comparative evaluation | Compare two evidence packs | Research |
| Regression detection | Detect conformance regressions | Research |

## 4. Governance Constraints

All future conformance extensions MUST:

### 4.1 Non-Breaking

Extensions MUST NOT:
- Change the meaning of existing outcomes
- Remove existing evaluation dimensions
- Break existing Evidence Pack compatibility

### 4.2 Versioned

Extensions MUST:
- Be tied to a protocol version
- Be explicitly declared in results
- Support backward compatibility

### 4.3 Evidence-Based

Extensions MUST:
- Evaluate only exported evidence
- Not require runtime access
- Preserve vendor neutrality

## 5. What Will NEVER Be Added

To prevent scope creep and maintain MPLP's positioning:

| Rejected Feature | Reason |
|:---|:---|
| **Certification programs** | MPLP is not a certification body |
| **Compliance badges** | No endorsement or branding |
| **Runtime monitoring** | Evidence-only design |
| **Quality scoring** | Binary conformance only |
| **Legal determinations** | Not a legal authority |

## 6. How to Propose Extensions

Conformance enhancements follow the standard MPLP Improvement Proposal (MIP) process:

1. Draft a proposal describing the extension
2. Submit as Standards Track MIP
3. Community review period
4. MPGC approval
5. Implementation and documentation

See [MIP Process](/docs/evaluation/governance/protocol-governance) for details.

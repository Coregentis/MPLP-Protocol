# How to Evaluate MPLP


### If You Are an Enterprise Architect

**Goal**: Assess technical fit and compliance posture

**Reading Order** (30 minutes):
1. [Architecture Overview](/docs/specification/architecture) — L1–L4 layer model
2. [Modules](/docs/specification/modules/core-module) — 10 module specifications
3. [Golden Flows](/docs/evaluation/golden-flows) — Validation scenarios
4. [Standards Mapping](/docs/evaluation/standards/positioning) — ISO/NIST/W3C alignment
5. [Enterprise Evaluation](/docs/evaluation/governance/protocol-governance) — Assessment checklist

**Key Questions Answered**:
- What does the protocol define?
- How do I verify implementation correctness?
- How does this relate to our compliance requirements?

### If You Are an Auditor / Compliance Reviewer

**Goal**: Gather evidence and verify claims

**Reading Order** (60 minutes):
1. Repo-Docs-Code Alignment (TBD) — Traceability
2. [Golden Flows](/docs/evaluation/golden-flows) — Validation evidence
3. [Standards Mapping](/docs/evaluation/standards/positioning) — External alignment
4. [External Consistency Summary](/docs/evaluation/governance/EXTERNAL_TRUST_OVERVIEW) — Controls
5. [Phase G Verification](/docs/evaluation/governance/protocol-governance) — Surface consistency

**Key Questions Answered**:
- Are claims backed by artifacts?
- Is behavior testable?
- Are governance controls documented?

## Verification Checklist

Before concluding your evaluation, verify:

- [ ] You understand the three-entry model (Website → Docs → Repo)
- [ ] You have read the Non-Claims section
- [ ] You understand who holds governance authority
- [ ] You know how to verify implementation correctness (Golden Flows)
- [ ] You understand the standards mapping scope and limitations

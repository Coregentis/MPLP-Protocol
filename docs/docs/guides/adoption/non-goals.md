# Adoption Non-Goals


## 1. Purpose

This document explicitly states what MPLP does **NOT** provide for adoption.

These are **deliberate exclusions** to maintain MPLP's role as a self-declaring, vendor-neutral protocol.

## 2. Explicit Non-Goals

### 2.1 Adoption Certification

| We Do NOT Provide | Reason |
|:---|:---|
| **"MPLP Adopter" certification** | No certification authority |
| **Adoption audits** | Self-declared only |
| **Adoption verification** | No external validation |
| **Adoption levels** | No tiered certification |

**Implication**: Any third-party "MPLP Adopter" program is not endorsed by MPLP.

### 2.2 Adoption Badges

| We Do NOT Provide | Reason |
|:---|:---|
| **"Powered by MPLP" badges** | No endorsement |
| **Adoption logos** | No branding program |
| **Partner badges** | Not a partnership |

**Implication**: Organizations may state MPLP adoption, but MPLP does not provide official badges.

### 2.3 Adoption Tracking

| We Do NOT Provide | Reason |
|:---|:---|
| **Adopter registry** | Not tracking adoption |
| **Adoption metrics** | External to protocol |
| **Adoption analytics** | Commercial realm |
| **Download tracking** | Privacy |

**Implication**: MPLP does not know who is adopting. Adoption is self-declared.

### 2.4 Adoption Support

| We Do NOT Provide | Reason |
|:---|:---|
| **Adoption consulting** | Commercial realm |
| **Enterprise support** | Vendor-specific |
| **Onboarding services** | Commercial realm |
| **Migration assistance** | Implementation-specific |

**Implication**: Adoption support is provided by vendors, not by MPLP.

## 3. Why Self-Declaration?

MPLP adoption is **self-declared** because:

### 3.1 Protocol Neutrality

If MPLP tracked or certified adoption:
- We would have a registry (privacy concern)
- We would make judgments (certification authority)
- We would pick winners (vendor bias)

### 3.2 Adoption Is a Spectrum

Adoption is not binary. A system can:
- Be evaluating MPLP
- Be piloting MPLP
- Be in production with MPLP
- Be partially conformant
- Be fully conformant

No external authority can accurately judge this.

### 3.3 Conformance Handles Technical Validation

For technical validation:
- Use **Conformance** (16-conformance)
- Conformance is binary (CONFORMANT / NON-CONFORMANT)
- Conformance is evidence-based

Adoption is the **organizational state**, not the technical state.

## 4. What Adoption DOES Provide

| We DO Provide | How |
|:---|:---|
| **Lifecycle definition** | Evaluation → Pilot → Production |
| **Signal definitions** | Observable indicators |
| **Self-verification method** | Check signals against stage |
| **Clear boundaries** | Adoption ≠ Conformance ≠ Certification |

**Key Principle**: Adoption is self-declared, not certified  
**Purpose**: Prevent scope creep and maintain neutrality

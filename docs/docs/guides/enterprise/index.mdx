# Enterprise Context


## 1. What Enterprise Means

Enterprise is NOT:
- More users
- Bigger machines
- Premium features

Enterprise is:
- **Longer lifecycles** — Systems must remain auditable for years
- **Organizational accountability** — Someone is always responsible
- **Mandatory governance** — Judgment is not optional
- **Change ownership** — Every mutation has an authority

## 2. Enterprise vs. Conformance

| Aspect | Conformance (16-conformance) | Enterprise (17-enterprise) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Question** | Can this system be judged? | Must this system be judged? |
| **Scope** | Technical evaluation | Organizational accountability |
| **Evidence** | Evidence Pack structure | Evidence chain ownership |
| **Approval** | Binary outcome | Authority hierarchy |
| **Timeline** | Point-in-time evaluation | Longitudinal auditability |

**Key Insight**:
- **Conformance** = Technical capability to be evaluated
- **Enterprise** = Organizational requirement to be evaluated

## 3. Enterprise Constraints ↔ Kernel Duties Mapping

> [!NOTE]
> The Enterprise context does **not** introduce new protocol obligations.
> It **activates** existing kernel duties under non-negotiable organizational constraints.

### 3.1 Full Mapping (11 Kernel Duties)

| Enterprise Constraint | Kernel Duty | Required Evidence | Conformance Dimension |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Authority chain** | `confirm` + `security` | Confirm record links to approver identity | Governance Gating |
| **Long lifecycle** | `protocol-version` + `trace` | Version binding, change log, replayability | Version Declaration |
| **Audit & liability** | `trace` + `transaction` | Deterministic evidence pack + integrity chain | Trace Integrity |
| **Cross-team concurrency** | `state-sync` + `transaction` | Conflict decisions, rollback/snapshot evidence | Lifecycle Completeness |
| **Cost control** | `performance` | Budget events, throttling decisions | (Informative) |
| **Failure ownership** | `error-handling` | Recovery events, root cause records | Failure Bounding |
| **Coordination accountability** | `coordination` | Module interaction trace | Lifecycle Completeness |
| **Execution audit** | `orchestration` | Step execution sequence | Trace Integrity |
| **Event durability** | `event-bus` | Event log persistence | Trace Integrity |
| **Action isolation** | `AEL` | Execution boundary records | Schema Validity |
| **State persistence** | `VSL` | Snapshot/restore evidence | (Informative) |

### 3.2 Key Insight

Every cell in this table answers one question:

> "When Enterprise constraint X is active, what evidence MUST exist to be conformant?"

This is not a guide. This is a **protocol-to-constraint projection**.

## 4. Enterprise Constraints

When MPLP enters enterprise environments, these constraints become **mandatory**:

### 4.1 Authority Chains

Every governance decision (`Confirm`) must trace to a human authority:

| Role | Responsibility |
|:---|:---|
| **Plan Approver** | Authorizes execution scope |
| **Risk Owner** | Accepts liability for high-risk actions |
| **Change Authority** | Approves protocol/schema changes |
| **Audit Authority** | Reviews evidence chains |

### 4.2 Longitudinal Auditability

Enterprise systems must answer questions **years after execution**:

- "Who approved this plan on 2024-03-15?"
- "What was the agent's context when it made this decision?"
- "Can we reconstruct the execution from evidence alone?"

MPLP's evidence model enables this, but **enterprise environments make it mandatory**.

### 4.3 Organizational Governance

Single-user projects don't need:
- Role separation
- Approval workflows
- Change control boards
- Audit committees

Enterprise environments **always** need these. MPLP provides the **protocol hooks** (Confirm, Role, Trace), but enterprise contexts **activate** them.

### 4.4 Failure Ownership

In enterprise:
- Failures have real consequences
- Someone is always accountable
- Recovery must be documented
- Root cause is required

MPLP's bounded failure model maps directly to enterprise incident management.

## 5. What This Section Provides

| Document | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| [This Index](./index.mdx) | Defines Enterprise scope + Kernel mapping |
| [Enterprise Scenarios](./enterprise-scenarios.md) | Constraint → Evidence → Conformance cards |
| [Non-Goals](./non-goals.md) | What MPLP does NOT provide for enterprise |

## 6. What This Section Does NOT Provide

To prevent scope creep and maintain MPLP's positioning:

| We Do NOT Provide | Reason |
|:---|:---|
| **Enterprise certification** | Not a certification body |
| **Compliance guarantees** | Not a legal authority |
| **Deployment architectures** | Implementation-specific |
| **SaaS or managed services** | Vendor-specific |
| **Enterprise pricing** | Not a commercial product |
| **Vendor integrations** | Vendor-neutral by design |

MPLP provides the **protocol substrate**. Enterprise vendors build products on top.

## 7. Relationship to Other Sections

| Section | Relationship |
|:---|:---|
| **08-guides** | How to implement (Guides) vs. Why you cannot avoid (Enterprise) |
| **12-governance** | Protocol governance vs. Organizational governance |
| **16-conformance** | Technical judgment vs. Mandatory judgment |

# Examples (Non-Normative)

This section contains **non-normative executable examples** that demonstrate how MPLP protocol semantics *can* be exercised using an SDK.

These examples:
- Are **not specifications**
- Are **not recommendations**
- Do **not represent a reference architecture**
- Do **not imply production readiness**

MPLP conformance is defined **only** by the protocol specifications and validation artifacts, not by these examples.

## Available Examples

| Example | Description |
|:---|:---|
| [**Example 01: Minimal SA Lifecycle**](./example-01-minimal-sa-lifecycle) | Demonstrates a minimal Single-Agent lifecycle (Context → Plan → Trace) using the SDK. |

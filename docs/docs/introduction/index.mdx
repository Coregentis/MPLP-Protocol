# Introduction to MPLP

Welcome to the **Multi-Agent Lifecycle Protocol (MPLP)** documentation. This section provides foundational context for understanding the protocol's purpose, scope, and design philosophy.

## What is MPLP?

MPLP is a **vendor-neutral, schema-first specification** that defines how multi-agent systems should govern their lifecycle — from initialization through execution to completion and audit.

> **MPLP is not a runtime, framework, or product.** It is a normative specification that enables interoperability across diverse agent implementations.

## Documentation Structure

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [Protocol Overview](/docs/introduction/mplp-v1.0-protocol-overview) | High-level introduction to MPLP concepts |
| [Docs Map](/docs/introduction/mplp-v1.0-docs-map) | Navigation guide for the documentation |
| [API Quick Reference](/docs/introduction/api-quick-reference) | Schema and endpoint summary |
| [Glossary](/docs/introduction/glossary) | Terminology definitions |
| [POSIX Analogy](/docs/introduction/posix-analogy-mapping) | Conceptual mapping to familiar OS concepts |

## Key Principles

1. **Schema is Truth** — All behavior is defined by JSON schemas, not prose
2. **Vendor Neutral** — No dependency on specific runtimes or frameworks
3. **Audit-Ready** — Every lifecycle event is traceable and verifiable
4. **Substrate Agnostic** — Works across LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, etc.

## Getting Started

- Start with the [Protocol Overview](/docs/introduction/mplp-v1.0-protocol-overview) for conceptual grounding
- Explore the [Specification](/docs/specification) for normative requirements
- See [Examples](/docs/guides/examples) for practical implementations

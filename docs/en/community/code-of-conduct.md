## ü§ù Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers of the MPLP (Multi-Agent Protocol Lifecycle Platform) community pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

As the **first production-ready multi-agent protocol platform** with **100% module completion** and **2,869/2,869 tests passing**, MPLP represents a significant achievement in open source collaboration. We are committed to maintaining the same high standards in our community interactions as we do in our code quality.

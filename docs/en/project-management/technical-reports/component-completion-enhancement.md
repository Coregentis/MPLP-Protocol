    let hasError = false;
    
    listeners.forEach(listener => {
      try {
        listener(...args);
      } catch (error) {
        // Improve error handling to avoid uncaught exceptions in tests
        this.handleListenerError(event, error, listener);
        hasError = true;
      }
    });
    
    return !hasError;
  }
  
  private handleListenerError(event: string, error: Error, listener: Function): void {

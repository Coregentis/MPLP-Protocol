# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of MPLP with security updates:

| Version | Supported          | End of Life |
| ------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: | TBD         |
| < 1.0   | :x:                | Immediately |

## Security Standards

### Code Security
- All code is scanned with CodeQL and Semgrep
- Dependencies are regularly audited with `npm audit`
- No secrets or sensitive information in source code
- TypeScript strict mode for type safety

### Supply Chain Security
- All dependencies are verified and audited
- License compliance checking (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD variants only)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Package integrity verification

### Release Security
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- Multi-factor authentication for npm publishing
- Signed releases and tags
- Reproducible builds

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report
Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing **security@mplp.dev** (or your designated security email).

**Do NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

### What to Include
Please include the following information in your report:

1. **Description** of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Potential impact** assessment
4. **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
5. **Your contact information** for follow-up

### Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Triage**: Within 5 business days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-7 days
  - High: 7-30 days
  - Medium: 30-90 days
  - Low: Next scheduled release

### Severity Levels

#### Critical
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Data exposure of sensitive information
- Privilege escalation

#### High
- Denial of service attacks
- Local privilege escalation
- Information disclosure

#### Medium
- Cross-site scripting (if applicable)
- Input validation issues
- Dependency vulnerabilities

#### Low
- Information leakage
- Minor security improvements

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Installation
```bash
# Always install from official npm registry
npm install mplp

# Verify package integrity
npm audit

# Check for known vulnerabilities
npm audit --audit-level=moderate
```

### Usage
```typescript
// Use TypeScript for type safety
import { CoreOrchestrator } from 'mplp';

// Validate all inputs
const config = validateConfig(userConfig);
const orchestrator = new CoreOrchestrator(config);

// Handle errors securely
try {
  const result = await orchestrator.executeWorkflow(contextId);
} catch (error) {
  // Don't expose internal details in error messages
  logger.error('Workflow execution failed', { contextId });
  throw new Error('Workflow execution failed');
}
```

### Configuration Security
```typescript
// Don't hardcode sensitive values
const config = {
  // ❌ Don't do this
  apiKey: 'sk-1234567890abcdef',
  
  // ✅ Use environment variables
  apiKey: process.env.API_KEY,
  
  // ✅ Use secure defaults
  timeout_ms: 30000,
  max_concurrent_executions: 50
};
```

## Security Features

### Built-in Security
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated against TypeScript types
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- **Timeout Protection**: Configurable timeouts prevent resource exhaustion
- **Concurrency Limits**: Built-in limits prevent DoS attacks

### Performance Security
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage prevents memory exhaustion
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable limits for CPU and memory usage
- **Caching Security**: Cache keys are properly isolated and validated

### Monitoring and Logging
- **Audit Logging**: All significant operations are logged
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in performance monitoring
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error tracking and reporting
